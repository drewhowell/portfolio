        <p class=aboutmeinfo>I was born and raised just outside of Atlanta - near Stone Mountain, GA. I enjoy spending time with my 3 best friends and my dog, Scout. My greatest passion is traveling and getting to see the world.</p> 
        
        <p class=aboutmeinfo>I've been lucky enough to work for an Atlanta-based software company for almost 9 years now. I lead product for our Atlanta & San Diego product lines. My first real job out of college was working for said company as a customer support representative. I've worn many hats throughout the years - Software Tester, Software Designer, Software Marketer, Product Manager, Scrum Master - you name it!</p>

         <p class=aboutmeinfo> I am now embarking on this new journey to learn as much as I can about Full Stack Development so that I can enhance my knownledge of our product and hopefully support my team members better. The goal is to continue to provide the best possible solution to our end users and I believe that as a product leader, I can better support our customers if I know our solution from beginning to end.</p>
